Hi sir,

Please take note that the video has many cuts. This is not done to hide any functionality whatsoever, but rather to cut on time as everything was filmed in 1 take 
and there was a lot of time spent doing bla bla, filling in fields for the forms, etc. In an effort to keep the video closer to the 5 min and to still present everything
the decision to cut these moments was made. As you can still see, the time at the bottom of the screen, as well as the screen itself does not change, there are only the jumps to save the time as mentionned above.
If for some reason you find that something is missing or not shown well enough in the videos, please send us a mio so that we can remedy to the issue within the shortest delays. We have the original uncut
videos if need be and could send / provide more if you cannot see somnething in the code or if the code doesn't run on your end, whatever the problem may be.

Enjoy your summer and thank you for an amazing semester learning kotlin and the joys of Android development,
Kindly,
Oliver, Maria, Yacine.
